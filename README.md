## ApiKeys
The app will not work without the correct implementation of the api keys. To add them you should just add a**"apikey.properties"**file using your [Marvel Documentation keys](https://developer.marvel.com/account) :

```
CONSUMER_KEY="<Marvel Public Api key>"
CONSUMER_SECRET="<Marvel Private Api key>"
```
